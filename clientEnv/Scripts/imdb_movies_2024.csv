Although descended from two brothers who live in peace, Dhritarashtra and Pandu, the cousins' rivalry leads to death and destruction and jeopardizes the very fabric of the universe. Born blind, Dhritarashtra, the elder brother, sits on the throne. His sons, the Kauravas, led by the ambitious and envious Duryodhana, seek to maintain their hold on power. In contrast, Pandu's sons, the Pandavas, led by the righteous Yudhishthira, seek to claim what they believe is rightfully theirs, and nothing more. The conflict between the two families intensifies over time, fuelled by jealousy, greed, and betrayal. The story weaves through a rich tapestry of events, including an infamous game of dice in which Yudhishthira loses his kingdom and freedom. The Pandavas find themselves in exile until their eventual return to fight and reclaim what is rightfully theirs. After years of tension and conflict, the only possible resolution is a battle of epic proportions, in which warriors of unparalleled strength destroy each other in a clash over the fate of the kingdom. Led by the noble Arjuna and guided by the divine Krishna, the Pandavas face off against their cousins, teachers, and friends on the battlefield. The war is not merely a clash of armies but a moral and philosophical struggle, testing in each person the principles of righteousness and duty. In the end, the Pandavas emerge victorious, but victory comes at a heavy price.

After a century of colonialist rule, Haida culture was nearly obliterated, with language and traditions fading, and the land stripped of its resources. But a committed group of Haida and their supporters took a stand, demanding a stop to clear-cut logging practices that had destroyed salmon habitat and ravaged old-growth forest. In the face of overwhelming pressure from the RCMP, private logging interests and even the media, the defenders called for the government to work with Indigenous people to find a way to protect the land and the future. In a riveting new feature documentary drawn from more than a hundred hours of archival footage and audio, award-winning director Christopher Auchter (Now Is the Time (2019)) recreates the courage, tenacity and tension of this critical turning point. From furious showdowns between television pundit Jack Webster and Haida leader Miles Richardson, to the support of then-NDP MLA Svend Robinson, The Stand captures the struggle as it unfolds on a moment-to-moment basis. As a complex battle played out on remote logging roads, in the legal system and in the court of public opinion, authorities staged a steady propaganda campaign, alongside stalling tactics and a police presence, to undermine the Haida cause. With the whole world watching, would the Haida hold fast to their strategy of peaceful resistance, or would violence erupt? The parallels between past and present continue to resound, as the Lyell Island blockade laid the foundations for current land-claim treaties across Canada. From the Haida Nation's resolute act of vision and conscience emerged an unbreakable commitment to justice, solidarity and Indigenous sovereignty that echoes forth to this day."

Her older brother Max has emigrated to the Dutch East Indies, now Indonesia. In her letters to Max, Rusha recounts daily life in the city.

The combination of Rusha's letters and archival footage creates a colorful portrait of proud diamond cutters; haggling traders at the flea market; cabaret artists with songs that everyone sings along to; city officials like De Miranda, who are committed to social housing; and the entrepreneurs behind warehouse De Bijenkorf, the luxurious Amstel Hotel, and cinema Tuschinski. These stories illustrate the importance of the Jewish community to the city. The initial optimism after World War I is gradually tested by a severe economic depression and the rise of fascism, leading to the occupation of The Netherlands. Humor and zest for life, the ""lechajim,"" provide comfort to the Jews in times of adversity. Against this backdrop, Rusha grows from a young girl into an independent woman, lovingly navigating between the ideas of her socialist father and the religious beliefs of her husband. The outbreak of World War II presents her with an impossible choice. Neshoma is not only about the lives of those who are no longer here, but also about what they have left behind: the Jewish soul of Amsterdam, the neshoma."
