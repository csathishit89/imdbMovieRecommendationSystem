Watching you - Die Welt von Palantir und Alex Karp,"For the first time, a documentary examines US entrepreneur Alex Karp and his mysterious and insular company, Palantir. Along with Elon Musk, his co-founder Peter Thiel, and Sam Altman, the CEO of Palantir is considered one of the most important digital leaders. Like them, Karp is benefiting from the election of Donald Trump as US president. But he is still relatively unknown in this country - even though German police authorities also work with Palantir's software, Gotham. The successful yet controversial data analysis program specializes in bundling and visualizing large amounts of data for the purpose of intelligence gathering and surveillance. Gotham can create profiles of individuals worldwide through digital data analysis. The software supports intelligence agencies, the military, and police authorities, the latter also in Hesse and Bavaria, with information that can be used, for example, in the fight against terrorism - or for targeted killings. Palantir is currently an important partner of Ukraine in its defensive war against Russia. The company rose to prominence through its work for the CIA and NSA. With their help, Osama Bin Laden is said to have been brought down. In 2024, Palantir was temporarily valued at over $220 billion on the stock market. One founder, Peter Thiel, is a right-wing libertarian and Trump supporter. The other, Alex Karp, describes himself as a ""neo-Marxist and leftist,"" holds a doctorate in philosophy from Frankfurt, and likes to mention that his parents were ""hippies."" He even offers Thai Chi classes for his employees - and teaches them himself. Today, he leads the world's largest commercial surveillance company as CEO. Forbes estimates his net worth at $9.7 billion. The film takes a look at one of the most mysterious and powerful men of our time.",first time documentary examines us entrepreneur alex karp mysterious insular company palantir along elon musk cofounder peter thiel sam altman ceo palantir considered one important digital leaders like karp benefiting election donald trump us president still relatively unknown country even though german police authorities also work palantirs software gotham successful yet controversial data analysis program specializes bundling visualizing large amounts data purpose intelligence gathering surveillance gotham create profiles individuals worldwide digital data analysis software supports intelligence agencies military police authorities latter also hesse bavaria information used example fight terrorism targeted killings palantir currently important partner ukraine defensive war russia company rose prominence work cia nsa help osama bin laden said brought palantir temporarily valued billion stock market one founder peter thiel rightwing libertarian trump supporter alex karp describes neomarxist leftist holds doctorate philosophy frankfurt likes mention parents hippies even offers thai chi classes employees teaches today leads worlds largest commercial surveillance company ceo forbes estimates net worth billion film takes look one mysterious powerful men time

Bahodir Yalangto'sh,"In the heart of the 17th-century Uzbek Bukhara Khanate, a time of ruthless power struggles and looming external threats, Bahodir Yalangto'sh rises not as a man of royal blood, but as a fearless warrior and shrewd tactician. Born into a humble Uzbek family, his extraordinary skill in battle and unwavering loyalty to the state catch the eye of the aging Imamquli Khan. As the Khanate faces a new, formidable enemy-the relentless Safavids under Shah Abbas II - Imamquli Khan appoints Bahodir as the new governor of Samarkand, a city teetering on the brink of chaos and rebellion. Bahodir's mission is twofold: to fortify the city against the impending invasion and to quell the internal strife caused by treacherous nobles who seek to usurp power. Navigating a web of political intrigue and betrayal, Bahodir must earn the trust of the skeptical Samarkand elites while unifying the disparate tribes under a single banner. He faces not only the overwhelming might of the Persian army but also a personal challenge when he uncovers a deep-seated conspiracy involving a close friend and a forbidden love interest. The film culminates in a breathtaking, epic siege of Samarkand, where Bahodir's strategic genius is put to the ultimate test. In a battle where every decision could mean the difference between freedom and subjugation, he must prove that true leadership is not inherited but forged in the fire of courage and sacrifice. ""Bahodir Yalangto'sh"" is a gripping tale of a common man who, through his valor and intellect, becomes a legendary Uzbek hero and saves his people from the brink of extinction.",heart thcentury uzbek bukhara khanate time ruthless power struggles looming external threats bahodir yalangtosh rises man royal blood fearless warrior shrewd tactician born humble uzbek family extraordinary skill battle unwavering loyalty state catch eye aging imamquli khan khanate faces new formidable enemythe relentless safavids shah abbas ii imamquli khan appoints bahodir new governor samarkand city teetering brink chaos rebellion bahodirs mission twofold fortify city impending invasion quell internal strife caused treacherous nobles seek usurp power navigating web political intrigue betrayal bahodir must earn trust skeptical samarkand elites unifying disparate tribes single banner faces overwhelming might persian army also personal challenge uncovers deepseated conspiracy involving close friend forbidden love interest film culminates breathtaking epic siege samarkand bahodirs strategic genius put ultimate test battle every decision could mean difference freedom subjugation must prove true leadership inherited forged fire courage sacrifice bahodir yalangtosh gripping tale common man valor intellect becomes legendary uzbek hero saves people brink extinction

Peter Brook's the Mahabharata (8K),"The Mahabharata unfolds in an ancient time in India, then known as Bharatavarsha. Two groups of cousins from the same royal family, the Pandavas and the Kauravas, vie for control of the Kingdom. Although descended from two brothers who live in peace, Dhritarashtra and Pandu, the cousins' rivalry leads to death and destruction and jeopardizes the very fabric of the universe. Born blind, Dhritarashtra, the elder brother, sits on the throne. His sons, the Kauravas, led by the ambitious and envious Duryodhana, seek to maintain their hold on power. In contrast, Pandu's sons, the Pandavas, led by the righteous Yudhishthira, seek to claim what they believe is rightfully theirs, and nothing more. The conflict between the two families intensifies over time, fuelled by jealousy, greed, and betrayal. The story weaves through a rich tapestry of events, including an infamous game of dice in which Yudhishthira loses his kingdom and freedom. The Pandavas find themselves in exile until their eventual return to fight and reclaim what is rightfully theirs. After years of tension and conflict, the only possible resolution is a battle of epic proportions, in which warriors of unparalleled strength destroy each other in a clash over the fate of the kingdom. Led by the noble Arjuna and guided by the divine Krishna, the Pandavas face off against their cousins, teachers, and friends on the battlefield. The war is not merely a clash of armies but a moral and philosophical struggle, testing in each person the principles of righteousness and duty. In the end, the Pandavas emerge victorious, but victory comes at a heavy price. The war leaves behind a trail of destruction and loss, leaving them and us to question the very nature of victory and the true cost of power.",mahabharata unfolds ancient time india known bharatavarsha two groups cousins royal family pandavas kauravas vie control kingdom although descended two brothers live peace dhritarashtra pandu cousins rivalry leads death destruction jeopardizes fabric universe born blind dhritarashtra elder brother sits throne sons kauravas led ambitious envious duryodhana seek maintain hold power contrast pandus sons pandavas led righteous yudhishthira seek claim believe rightfully nothing conflict two families intensifies time fuelled jealousy greed betrayal story weaves rich tapestry events including infamous game dice yudhishthira loses kingdom freedom pandavas find exile eventual return fight reclaim rightfully years tension conflict possible resolution battle epic proportions warriors unparalleled strength destroy clash fate kingdom led noble arjuna guided divine krishna pandavas face cousins teachers friends battlefield war merely clash armies moral philosophical struggle testing person principles righteousness duty end pandavas emerge victorious victory comes heavy price war leaves behind trail destruction loss leaving us question nature victory true cost power

The Stand,"On a misty morning in the fall of 1985, a small group of Haida people blockaded a muddy dirt road on Lyell Island (then known as the Queen Charlotte Islands). After a century of colonialist rule, Haida culture was nearly obliterated, with language and traditions fading, and the land stripped of its resources. But a committed group of Haida and their supporters took a stand, demanding a stop to clear-cut logging practices that had destroyed salmon habitat and ravaged old-growth forest. In the face of overwhelming pressure from the RCMP, private logging interests and even the media, the defenders called for the government to work with Indigenous people to find a way to protect the land and the future. In a riveting new feature documentary drawn from more than a hundred hours of archival footage and audio, award-winning director Christopher Auchter (Now Is the Time (2019)) recreates the courage, tenacity and tension of this critical turning point. From furious showdowns between television pundit Jack Webster and Haida leader Miles Richardson, to the support of then-NDP MLA Svend Robinson, The Stand captures the struggle as it unfolds on a moment-to-moment basis. As a complex battle played out on remote logging roads, in the legal system and in the court of public opinion, authorities staged a steady propaganda campaign, alongside stalling tactics and a police presence, to undermine the Haida cause. With the whole world watching, would the Haida hold fast to their strategy of peaceful resistance, or would violence erupt? The parallels between past and present continue to resound, as the Lyell Island blockade laid the foundations for current land-claim treaties across Canada. From the Haida Nation's resolute act of vision and conscience emerged an unbreakable commitment to justice, solidarity and Indigenous sovereignty that echoes forth to this day.",misty morning fall small group haida people blockaded muddy dirt road lyell island known queen charlotte islands century colonialist rule haida culture nearly obliterated language traditions fading land stripped resources committed group haida supporters took stand demanding stop clearcut logging practices destroyed salmon habitat ravaged oldgrowth forest face overwhelming pressure rcmp private logging interests even media defenders called government work indigenous people find way protect land future riveting new feature documentary drawn hundred hours archival footage audio awardwinning director christopher auchter time recreates courage tenacity tension critical turning point furious showdowns television pundit jack webster haida leader miles richardson support thenndp mla svend robinson stand captures struggle unfolds momenttomoment basis complex battle played remote logging roads legal system court public opinion authorities staged steady propaganda campaign alongside stalling tactics police presence undermine haida cause whole world watching would haida hold fast strategy peaceful resistance would violence erupt parallels past present continue resound lyell island blockade laid foundations current landclaim treaties across canada haida nations resolute act vision conscience emerged unbreakable commitment justice solidarity indigenous sovereignty echoes forth day

Skategoat,"Leandre Sanders was born in Venice Beach, LA, into a world of gangs and crime. The only thing that kept him out of trouble was his love of skateboarding. While his older brothers joined the family tradition of running with gangs, Leandre - dubbed Skategoat - spent most of his days and nights at Venice Beach skatepark with his younger brother Leontay. He was so talented and determined that, at the age of 11, he caught the eye of filmmaker Van Alpert. Over the next ten years, Van documented Leandre's struggle to perfect his skateboarding and to survive. At 14-years old, Leandre was forced to leave his rapidly unravelling family life and started sleeping rough at the bowl of the skate park, relying on his friend Haden and the kindness of a local woman, Katie, who looked out for the two boys. And despite this adversity, Leandre never lost his drive to skate - Set against the visually palpable decline of LA, the decade captured by Van charts Leandre's journey to an internationally-respected skater who has perfected his own unique 'no stance' skate style. The result is a gritty reflection of what it takes to make it in the skating world - and what it takes to survive as a disadvantaged kid in the United States. Pulsing with a tactile sense of street style and punctuated by an incredible soundtrack.

The Silmarillion: Oath of Feanor,"An artist by the fireside opens Tolkien's ""Silmarillion"".

Kosukha). Not action, but meditation on good and evil. The adaptation preserves the book's spirit: mythology lives through painting. Viewers see not special effects, but the power of word and image - ""the precious word in the metaphysics of art"" (Katehon).",artist fireside opens tolkiens silmarillion paintings come alive creation arda melkors fall fëanors oath silmarils beren lúthiens love one actor portrays key first age heroes valar men heroes step canvases speak storyteller enact dramas pride betrayal minimalism amplifies myth three locations fireside blackwhite backdrop create epic illusion ardas lamps fade light love eternal film reveals tolkiens christian subtext melkor steals silmarils symbols divine light beren lúthiens sacrifice defeats death true love power life dir kosukha action meditation good evil adaptation preserves books spirit mythology lives painting viewers see special effects power word image precious word metaphysics art katehon

Neshoma,"Neshoma is set in Amsterdam between World War I & II, when one out of ten of the city's residents was Jewish. Seventeen-year-old Rusha lives in the Jewish quarter with her family. Her older brother Max has emigrated to the Dutch East Indies, now Indonesia. In her letters to Max, Rusha recounts daily life in the city. This creates a vivid image of Amsterdam during the interwar period, from the perspective of the Jewish community. The film begins shortly after World War I, a period full of confidence in the future. The combination of Rusha's letters and archival footage creates a colorful portrait of proud diamond cutters; haggling traders at the flea market; cabaret artists with songs that everyone sings along to; city officials like De Miranda, who are committed to social housing; and the entrepreneurs behind warehouse De Bijenkorf, the luxurious Amstel Hotel, and cinema Tuschinski. These stories illustrate the importance of the Jewish community to the city. The initial optimism after World War I is gradually tested by a severe economic depression and the rise of fascism, leading to the occupation of The Netherlands.
